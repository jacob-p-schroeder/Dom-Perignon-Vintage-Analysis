## Introduction
Dom Pérignon is a renowned brand of vintage Champagne produced by the French Champagne house Moët & Chandon, which is a part of the luxury goods company LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy). It is named after Dom Pérignon, a Benedictine monk who made important contributions to the production and quality of Champagne in the 17th century.

Dom Pérignon Champagne is known for its exceptional quality and prestige. It is made exclusively from Chardonnay and Pinot Noir grapes grown in the Champagne region of France. Each bottle is produced as a vintage Champagne, meaning it is made from grapes harvested in a single year, and only the best grapes are selected for production.

Dom Pérignon Champagne is characterized by its complexity, depth, and elegance. It undergoes a meticulous process of production, including hand harvesting, gentle pressing of the grapes, and aging in the cellars for several years before release. The final product typically exhibits a fine balance of fruitiness, minerality, and a creamy texture, with delicate bubbles.

Dom Pérignon is often regarded as one of the finest and most prestigious Champagnes in the world, sought after by collectors and enthusiasts alike for special occasions and celebrations. Its distinctive bottle design and iconic label contribute to its status as a symbol of luxury and excellence in the world of Champagne.

## Motivation
The short answer here is curiosity. Dom Pérignon is not produced every year. Only certain years produce a grape of high enough quality that they release a batch of champagne. The last vintage was released in 2013. Can we use different weather data along with machine learning classifiers to predict which new years will yield Dom Pérignon vintages.
